# Scanner, Parser and Compiler
A scanner, parser and compiler written in Python and also using the PLY library.

Each step up encapsulates the previous, its code should be integrated into the next step.
For example parser should have the scanner code within it. 

Compiler is incomplete, more work needed, however scanner and parser work perfectly well, using the test program this is editable to create your own test cases.
